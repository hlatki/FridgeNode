Dependencies
-------------------
node.js
socket.io v. .7

Bugs
-------------------
Doesn't work very well in Firefox. I think this has something to do
with socket.io and FlashSockets...Let me know if you figure it out!

About
------------------
This an imitation of magnetic poetry, but for the web 
and with some trendy technologies. Mostly it was just a learning
opportunity (which is my excuse for its buggy/ugly state)

Files
-----------------
server.js -- serves up the files deals with the sockets
client.js
wordstuff.js -- code for the words
style.css
index.html
